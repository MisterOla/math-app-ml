    "Linear algebra is to machine learning as flour to bakery: **every machine learning model is based in linear algebra, as every cake is based in flour**. It is not the only ingredient, of course. Machine learning models need vector calculus, probability, and optimization, as cakes need sugar, eggs, and butter. Applied machine learning, like bakery, is essentially about combining these mathematical ingredients in clever ways to create useful (tasty?) models. \n",

    "This document contains **introductory level linear algebra notes for applied machine learning**. It is meant as a reference rather than a comprehensive review. If you ever get confused by matrix multiplication, don't remember what was the $L_2$ norm, or the conditions for linear independence, this can serve as a quick reference. It also a good introduction for people that don't need a deep understanding of linear algebra, but still want to learn about the fundamentals to read about machine learning or to use pre-packaged machine learning solutions. Further, it is a good source for people that learned linear algebra a while ago and need a refresher.\n",

    "If you have to pic one book, I'd pic **Boyd's and Vandenberghe's Intro to applied linear algebra**, as it is the most beginner friendly book on linear algebra I've encounter. Every aspect of the notation is clearly explained and pretty much all the key content for applied machine learning is covered. The Linear Algebra Chapter in Goodfellow et al is a nice and concise introduction, but it may require some previous exposure to linear algebra concepts. Deisenroth et all book is probably the best and most comprehensive source for linear algebra for machine learning I've found, although it assumes that you are good at reading math (and at math more generally). Savov's book it's also great for beginners but requires time to digest. Professor Strang lectures are great too but I won't recommend it for absolute beginners.\n",

    "While writing about linear mappings, I realized the importance of having a basic understanding of a few concepts before approaching the study of linear algebra. If you are like me, you may not have formal mathematical training beyond high school. If so, I encourage you to read this section and spent some time wrapping your head around these concepts before going over the linear algebra content (otherwise, you might prefer to skip this part). I believe that reviewing these concepts is of great help to understand the *notation*, which in my experience is one of the main barriers to understand mathematics for nonmathematicians: we are *non*native speakers, so we are continuously building up our vocabulary.

    "Sets are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics. They are so fundamental that they are not defined in terms of anything else. On the contrary, other branches of mathematics are defined in terms of sets, including linear algebra. Put simply, **sets are well-defined collections of objects**. Such objects are called **elements or members** of the set. The crew of a ship, a caravan of camels, and the LA Lakers roster, are all examples of sets. The captain of the ship, the first camel in the caravan, and LeBron James are all examples of \"members\" or \"elements\" of their corresponding sets. We denote a set with an upper case italic letter as $\\textit{A}$. In the context of linear algebra, we say that a line is a set of points, and the set of all lines in the plane is a set of sets. Similarly, we can say that *vectors* are sets of points, and *matrices* sets of vectors."

    "Now we have covered the basics of vectors and matrices, we are ready to introduce the idea of a linear mapping. **Linear mappings**, also known as *linear transformations* and *linear functions*, indicate the correspondence between vectors in a vector space $\\textit{V}$ and the same vectors in a different vector space $\\textit{W}$. This is an abstract idea. I like to think about this in the following manner: imagine there is a multiverse as in Marvel comics, but instead of humans, aliens, gods, stars, galaxies, and superheroes, we have *vectors*. In this context, a linear mapping would indicate the *correspondence* of entities (i.e., planets, humans, superheroes, etc) *between universes*. Just imagine us, placidly existing in our own universe, and suddenly a *linear mapping* happens: our entire universe would be transformed into a different one, according to whatever rules the linear mapping has enforced. Now, switch *universes* for *vector spaces* and *us* by vectors, and you'll get the full picture. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words: \n",

    "\n",
    "As a result of satisfying those properties, linear mappings **preserve the structure of the original vector space**. Imagine a vector space $\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, like a grid on lines in a cartesian plane. Visually, preserving the structure of the vector space after a mapping means to: (1) the origin of the coordinate space remains fixed, and (2) the lines remain lines and parallel to each other.\n",

    "**Projections** are a fundamental type of linear (and affine) mappings for machine learning. If you have ever heard concepts like \"embeddings\", \"low-dimensional representaion\", or \"dimensionality reduction\", they all are examples of projections. Even linear regression and principal component analysis are exemplars of projections. Thus, projections allow to work with high-dimensional spaces (i.e., problems with many features or variables) more efficiently, by projecting such spaces into lower-dimensional spaces. this works because is often the case that a few dimensions contains most of the information to understand the relation between inputs and outputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, projections are *mappings from a space onto a subpace*, or from a set of vectors onto a subset of vectors. Additionally, projections are \"idempotent\", this is, the projection has the property to be *equal to its composition with itself*. In other words, when you wrap a projection $\\phi(x) = y$ into itself as $\\phi (\\phi (x))$, the result does not change, i.e., $\\phi (\\phi (x)) = y$. Formally, for a vector space $\\textit{V}$ and a vector subset $\\textit{U} \\subset \\textit{V}$, we define a projection $\\phi$ as:\n",

    "In Freudian psychoanalysis, *projection* is a defense mechanism of the \"ego\" (i.e., the sense of self), where a person denies the posession of a negative characteristic while attributing it to someone else, i.e., \"projecting\" what we don't like of us onto others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out, that the concept of projection in mathematics is not that different from the Freudian one. Just make the following analogy: you and foe of you, are represented as vectors in a 2-dimensional cartesian plane, as $\\textit{x}$ and $\\textit{y}$ respectively. The way on which you would project yourself onto your foe, is by tracing a perpendicular line ($\\textit{z}$) from you to him, as shown in Fig. X. Why perpendicular? Because this is the shortest distance between you and him, hence, the most efficient way to project yourself onto him. Now, the projection would be \"how much\" of yourself was \"splattered\" onto him, which is represented by the segment $\\textit{p}$ from the origin until the point where the perpendicular line touched your foe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, recall that lines crossing the origin form subspaces, hence vector $\\textbf{y}$ is a subspace, and that perpendicular lines form $90^{\\circ}$ angles, hence the **projection is orthogonal**.

    "Now, we want to express projections as matrices, i.e., as the matrix vector product $\\textit{P}_\\phi \\textbf{x}$. For this, recall that matrix-scalar multiplication is *commutative*,  hence we can perform a little of algeabric manipulation to find:\n",
